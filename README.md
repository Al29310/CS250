  Wihtin the agile methodology user stories help the scrum team by giving specific details as to what the end user wants. These can include a variety of things such as specific layouts or new features to the program. We need user stories as they provide a way for the scrum team to view things from the perspective of the end user and take their thoughts into consideration when developing a product.
  
  I believe the agile methodology is a great way to get a product up and running. I would place an emphasis on user stories as these are vital and will be needed throughout the development process. The only thing i do not like about agile is the fact that the daily scrum seems to resemble micro managment but i hope i am wrong.
  
  A good team memeber never looks down upon any other memeber of the team. They provide help when needed and pick other team members up when they are down. They avoid work place drama and keep things professional. They share ideas and gain insight from others.
